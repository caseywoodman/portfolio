            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I am a young professional in sports broadcasting with a full time role at Northwestern University. In my
                role
                I oversee the broadcast operations department which handles all audio & video for all of the athletic
                venues. My experience in this role has given me the opportunity to design, create & execute graphical
                and
                video elements that drive fan engagement & ticket sales. A few hobbies that I have are flying a drone,
                watching sports, and learning something that I don't know.</p>
