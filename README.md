<!-- Purpose of Application -->
## PURPOSE

The purpose of this application is to showcase my coding skillset to future employers. This application was created from scratch using HTML and CSS. The story of this application tells the skills that I have in a language that many know, but created in a language only coders would know
<!-- My Experience -->
## MY EXPERIENCE

The experience I have had creating this site was a positive one. From having to learn how HTML code needs to be parented together to trying to figure out how to center specific icons, this site has showcased those skills. 

Overall, I feel like this site has given me the opportunity to not only showcase my coding abilities but to also showcase visuals that are tangible for a future employer.
